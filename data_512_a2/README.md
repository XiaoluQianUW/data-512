# data-512-a2: Bias in the Data

In this assignment, I performed two analysis using datasets for toxicity as well as aggression. 

The goal of this assignment is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic on English Wikipedia from January 1 2008 through August 30 2020. The work process and analysis can be found in this well-documented [jupyter notebook](data_512_a2.ipynb).
